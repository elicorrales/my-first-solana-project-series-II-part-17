# my-first-solana-project-series-II-part-17

### This project is part of a series and includes a video.

See [Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/blockchain-tutorials/blob/main/README.md) for the overall document that
refers to all the series.  
  

## In this video we  
- reviewed how to create accounts with and without space
- learn that the account created with space by SystemProgram seemed not usable to pay for transactions
- were able to use both old and new versions of the Rust on-chain program
  - where the old version bombs when attempting to view an account with space
  - where the new version correctly views an account with space
