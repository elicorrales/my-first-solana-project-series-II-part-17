# my-first-solana-project-series-II-part-17

## In this video we  
- reviewed how to create accounts with and without space
- learn that the account created with space by SystemProgram seemed not usable to pay for transactions
- were able to use both old and new versions of the Rust on-chain program
  - where the old version bombs when attempting to view an account with space
  - where the new version correctly views an account with space
